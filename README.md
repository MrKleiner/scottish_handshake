# Wafer

Reinventing a wheel for simplicity and ending up with overengineered, overcomplicated and overbugged rubbish software.

Featuring:
- 100% cross-platform: If the target OS can run ffmpeg and python - it can run Wafer.
- Instant and easy setup
- Resumable file uploads
- 0 buffering folder downloads: Download petabytes-large folders at the cost of 3MB server RAM. Limitation: Cannot be resumed if client aborts the download before it's finished
- Workers: Distribute heavy computations over any amount of workers running on any OS which supports python and ffmpeg. Run anywhere: workers are connected to Wafer via network. Ask a friend to lend his PC for a day, run it on your own machines, spread a virus to silently run it on victim machines. Anywhere in any way.


Why does every scotsman has a bottle of fine, decades old bottle of whiskey reserved for the "right moment" ?
Because the "right moment" never comes...
